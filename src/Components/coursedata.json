More and more companies are migrating online while many new, never before seen businesses are created every day thanks to the power of this phenomenon. You know what that means? Higher demand for people just like you! \n\nBut the problem for these businesses is that while demand is high, supply is short. \n\nPlease don’t let a lack of knowledge stop you from having the career of your dreams, not when the knowledge you need is right here and is extremely affordable. \n\nDon’t worry, you won’t need to buy any additional courses, it’s all here.

  "description": "Teach Excel to Do Your Work FOR YOU. . .\n\nMicrosoft Office is everywhere, installed on over 750 million computers, but most users only know how to set up a basic table or maybe even do a few formulas here and there.\n\nIn my course, I teach you how to take Excel by the horns and make it do whatever you want, whenever you want. It can go through loads of information and create a printable report for you. You can make custom forms so that you can access, analyze, edit, or add new information quickly to your data tables/ worksheets.\n\nExcel programming utilizes a simple but effective tool called \"VBA\" - the hidden programming language that runs quietly in the background while you work. It’s very easy and straight-forward to use.\n\nI'll show you the easiest tricks to learn this basic language in a fun, progressive method. Learn at your own pace. With each of my short, info-packed lectures, you'll learn another essential skill that you can immediately use. You'll find yourself handling these Automation tools instantly and in any spreadsheet you already use every day. If there's one thing I'm good at - and my students are good at - it's AUTOMATION.\n\nMy motto is, \"If I'm not making everybody's job easier, quicker and more enjoyable, I don't deserve to have this job\" - and that's what I live by.\n\nTake this course and access your true potential.\n\nOh, and I want to be the first to hear about your New Raise you get once you're making Excel Programs and running everything on autopilot for your co-workers!\n\n-Dan\n\n\n\n\nHere's what some of the students are saying:\n\n“I love this course. Extremely easy to follow along. If you are looking to learn more about Excel this is it!” - Jim C.\n\n\n“Loving this course! The information is presented quite clear and concise, and it is a really great way of learning VB really fast, yesterday I was a total ignorant of the subject. Today I programmed my first macro and cannot wait to learn more.” - Marcela T.\n\n“I had experimented with VBA previously, but I really feel like this course is exactly what I needed to take my Excel knowledge to the next level. In only 2 weeks I've improved my reporting exponentially and it's all thanks to this course!\" - Ryan S.\n\n\n“You can't go wrong with Daniel Strong!” - Steven S.\n\n\n“The presenter explains in detail and demonstrates what he's covering, easy to follow along and learn!” - David B.\n\n“Teaches you the fundamental of VBA programming without any prior experience. Shows with easy to follow Example!. thanks for the video!”  - Sean C.\n\n\"I've taken several different VBA courses here on Udemy and this one from Daniel is by far the most interesting and easy to understand. I've done exactly 107 lectures so far and already was able to automate 80% of my tasks at work that I've been doing manually for years... I'm angry with myself because of the time I wasted by not buying this course earlier. I can't even imagine what I will be able to do after finishing the entire course :)\" - Robert\n\n\n“Well explained, easy to understand lectures. Enjoyable and informative videos.” - Marlena\n\n\n“Very clear explanations broken down in short videos. Daniel goes at a slow pace that is easy to follow and understand, even for people with no programming experience.” - Gustavo P.\n\n“Best course on VBA ever taken. Thanks a lot!” - Nikita L.\n\n“This is an excellent course!!!  There's a lot of good, useful \"stuff\" here.  The examples are practical and real-world!” - Todd W.\n\n“Wow, I thought I knew a little bit about Excel but clearly I had only seen the tip of the iceberg. This course has opened my eyes to the true power of VBA within excel. Great course, fantastic instructor.” - Scott K.\n\n“By large and far, one of the best step by step guide to VBA programming I have ever seen. I have been playing around with VBA for over a year now, have watched countless videos and have read numerous articles and \"How-to\" guides, but I have never seen something this complete, this throughout. I am amazed at how little I actually new about the VBA world. Thanks a million!” - Alex B.\n\n“Everything I have been looking for, you would have to buy multiple books for this level of instruction!” - Luke S.\n\n\"Excellent VBA basic to advance tutorial.\" – Sandeep G.\n\n\n“This course is good for beginners and for experienced programmers.  Experienced programmers may want to skip through some sections on basics, but it is good to see how the basics work in the context of and excell worksheet.  He goes over different events and triggers (like buttons) to execute code.  This is a really good course if you plan to do some pretty complex vba code with forms and reports.”  - Christian H.\n\n\n“Very helpful if you do any type of data analysis.” – Jonathan D.\n\n“I think this is an excellent gateway to the tools we need to use going forward. I like the\nhands on nature.” – Andre C.\n\n“Much better than other classes and seminars. Great course.” – Mark S.\n\n“The instructor made VBA easy and straight forward to use.” – Min Z.\n\n“Very thorough and practical.” – Juan S.\n\n\n\n\n***Now Available for Offline Viewing!***",

  "description": "What is the bottom line of this course?\n\nPut simply, it's a starting point to understand visual communication - it's more theoretical than practical, and will give you a solid foundation for your art learning and your art journey ahead. This course will not make you a professional artist, but it WILL give you foundations for reaching a professional level - and foundations are EVERYTHING in art.\n\nArt Fundamentals: Drawing and Painting Essentials covers the key foundational principles that underly artwork and it's creation. You'll discover the core fundamentals you need to know in order to be effective at learning to draw and paint, be it digital or traditional, in any style or genre. This course is designed for artists of all levels. \n\n  Master The Essential Foundational Principles Of Drawing and Painting \n\nLearn how images are built, from 2D shapes to final finished paintings\n\nUnderstand how looseness, line weights and penmanship impact your artwork\n\nGrasp the fundamentals of a strong art workflow, and the real goal of a \"rough\"\n\nGain insight on moving from vision to implementation, and reaching your idea\n\nRecognise the empirical patterns apparent in all artwork\n\nLearn to differentiate between art studies and art creation, and make real progress\n\nEmbrace true 3D drawing by learning to \"Draw Through\"\n\n  Learn Why Appealing Art Looks The Way It Does, And How To Do It \n\n            Professional concept artists, illustrators and painters have a deep understanding of how images are made - not just surface level things like \"how to draw a head\" or \"How to paint a sky\", but the in-depth background understanding of why an image looks good, and feels good to look at. I'll show you the important fundamentals you need to know in order to have strong foundations in principles of creating art, whether you want to draw, paint, create comics, design concept art or illustrate manga. \n\n            Art Fundamentals: Drawing and Painting Essentials covers key foundations of art creation for imaginative representational realism - drawing and painting realism from your imagination. This course is designed for imaginative and creative people who want to draw and paint from their minds, no matter the style or medium. \n\n            I've designed this course to be easily understood, and allow for efficient learning. Primarily focused on digital tools, most principles apply equally to traditional art tools as well, and you'll quickly see how you can switch between mediums easily. This first course covers the absolute foundations of imagery, and is a necessary step before moving onto other courses such as Perspective, Light and Form, Color, Composition, Anatomy, Character Design and Drawing, Environment Design, Industrial Design and many more. \n\n            Upon completing this course, you'll have a rock solid grasp of how art is made - both in terms of workflow, and fundamental principles. You'll be ready to approach studying other topics with the right artistic mindset, and a comprehensive set of skills. ",
  "for_who": "This course is for all levels of aspiring concept artists, illustrators, manga artists, comic artists, painters, industrial designers and imaginative realists.\nThis course is both for absolute beginners to art as well as high end art professionals, and is focused on the foundations of imaginative realism - that is, drawing and painting from your imagination. The course content can be implemented both traditionally and digitally. This course is not for you if you’re interested in non-realism art, such as abstraction."

  "description": "Javascript is the language that modern developers need to know, and know well. Truly knowing Javascript will get you a job, and enable you to build quality web and server applications.\n\nNOTE: This course includes information on ECMAScript 6 (ES6) the next version of Javascript!\n\nIn this course you will gain a deep understanding of Javascript, learn how Javascript works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems. You will find clarity in the parts that others, even experienced coders, may find weird, odd, and at times incomprehensible. You'll learn the beauty and deceptive power of this language that is at the forefront of modern software development today.\n\nThis course will cover such advanced concepts as objects and object literals, function expressions, prototypical inheritance, functional programming, scope chains, function constructors (plus new ES6 features), immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs), call, apply, bind, and more.\n\nWe'll take a deep dive into the source code of popular frameworks such as jQuery and Underscore to see how you can use your understanding of Javascript to learn (and borrow) from other's good code.\n\nFinally, you'll learn the foundations of how to build your own Javascript framework or library.\n\n\nWhat you'll learn in this course will make you a better Javascript developer, and improve your abilities in AngularJS, NodeJS, jQuery, React, Ember, MongoDB, and all other Javascript-based technologies!\n\nLearn to love Javascript, and code in it well.\n\nNote: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.",

  "description": "Do you want to become a programmer? Do you want to learn how to create games, automate your browser, visualize data, and much more?\n\nIf you’re looking to learn Python for the very first time or need a quick brush-up, this is the course for you!\n\nPython has rapidly become one of the most popular programming languages around the world. Compared to other languages such as Java or C++, Python consistently outranks and outperforms these languages in demand from businesses and job availability. The average Python developer makes over $1000 - this number is only going to grow in the coming years.\n\nThe best part? Python is one of the easiest coding languages to learn right now. It doesn’t matter if you have no programming experience or are unfamiliar with the syntax of Python. By the time you finish this course, you'll be an absolute pro at programming!\n\nThis course will cover all the basics and several advanced concepts of Python. We’ll go over:\n\nThe fundamentals of Python programming\n\nWriting and Reading to Files\n\nAutomation of Word and Excel Files\n\nWeb scraping with BeautifulSoup4\n\nBrowser automation with Selenium\n\nData Analysis and Visualization with MatPlotLib\n\nRegex parsing and Task Management\n\nGUI and Gaming with Tkinter\n\nAnd much more!\n\nIf you read the above list and are feeling a bit confused, don’t worry! As an instructor and student on Udemy for almost 4 years, I know what it’s like to be overwhelmed with boring and mundane. I promise you’ll have a blast learning the ins and outs of python. I’ve successfully taught over 2000+ students from over 200 countries jumpstart their programming journeys through my courses.\n\nHere’s what some of my students have to say:\n\n“I wish I started programming at a younger age like Avi.  This Python course was excellent for those that cringe at the thought of starting over from scratch with attempts to write programs once again. Python is a great building language for any beginner programmer. Thank you Avi!”\n\n\n\n\n“I had no idea about any programming language. With Avi's lectures, I'm now aware of several python concepts and I'm beginning to write my own programs. Avi is crisp and clear in his lectures and it is easy to catch the concepts and the depth of it through his explanations. Thanks, Avi for the wonderful course, You're awesome! It's helping me a lot :)”\n\n\n\n\n\"Videos are short and concise and well-defined in their title, this makes them easy to refer back to when a refresher is needed. Explanations aren't convoluted with complicated examples, which adds to the quick pace of the videos. I am very pleased with the decision to enroll in this course. Not only has it increased the pace I'm learning Python but I actively look forward to continuing the course, whenever I get the chance. Avi is friendly and energetic, absolutely delightful as an instructor.”\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Jumpstart your programming journey and dive into the world of Python by enrolling in this course today!",
  "for_who": "Even if you haven't touched coding before, it won't matter. The easy step-to-step lectures will quickly guide you through everything you'll need to know about coding, mainly Python.

  "description": "One of the best Practical Courses in UDEMY ........\n\n\nOver 5,000 Students taking this course already.........\n\nLooking for a quick and easy way to learn Javascript?\n\n                  This course if for absolute beginners, and it is an introduction to the major components of javascript. By learning the bigger things in Javascript, you will be able to know how to put the remaining pieces together and will be able to get into advanced courses more prepared. \n\n  I'm not going to start this course with False promises. \n\n                  At the end of this course, you will NOT become an expert and nor will you in any other course. To become an expert in Javascript or any other programming language you need many hours of practice and experience; more like years of practice and experience. \n\n  My PROMISE to you. \n\n                  My promise to you is that all the lessons you will see here, will get engraved in your brain better than in any other course, why? My approach is the practice approach which is the number one key to learning any programming language or technical course faster and easier. \n\n  I created a small practice application for you inside the exercise files. At the end of every section, we will jump into this small application together, and practice everything we covered in the past lectures. This approach will make sure that you can retain the information you learned longer. \n\n        My goal is to help you understand the major components and prepare you for advanced courses, in this way you can transition to the language easier. \n\n                            Once you know the major parts of the Javascript language, everything else will be very easy to learn, and that is exactly what this course will provide you. \n\n                            With years of programming experience invested in this course, you can rest assured that the information supplied in this course will prepare you to jump into any advanced Javascript course and come out on top. \n\n        Commonly Asked Questions.....   \n\n        Q: Is Javascript easy?   \n\n                            A: Yes and no \n\n                            It depends on the teacher and the student. Learning Javascript is like learning a regular language, you need the major components and then you can start putting everything together. Students that jump into advanced Javascript courses might get confused and take longer to learn the language if they are not prepared with the major concepts. \n\n                            This course's approach is to teach you the major components not just by watching but also practicing after every section so that you get an understanding of the overall logic of the Javascript language. I find this approach to be better than jumping into an advanced course that will confuse you and leave clueless not knowing what to next, and this is why I built this crash course. \n\n        Q: Can I actually make money with Javascript?   \n\n                            A: Yes and yes. \n\n                            The market for Javascript is enormous and is in demand right now in any part of the world. Having a programming language like Javascript in your toolset will help you make more money regardless if you are working a regular job or freelancing. Javascript is one of the highest paying programming languages out there, and it will stay like that for a very long time. \n\n                            This Javascript Course Covers the following and then some... \n\nIntroduction to the language\n\nUnderstanding Javascript variables\n\nUnderstanding Javascript arrays\n\nUnderstanding Javascript functions\n\nUnderstanding Javascript Loops\n\nUnderstanding Javascript Math\n\nPracticing Javascript variables\n\nPracticing Javascript Arrays\n\nPracticing Javascript Functions\n\n\n\n\nPracticing Javascript Loops\n\nPracticing Javascript Math operations\n\nand lots more.....\n\n                            And because I like what I do, I will be adding more lectures in the future. What are you waiting for? Start learning by doing, and take the course now. The sooner you start the better. ",

  "description": "NEW PYTHON CODE \n\nThis python for beginners course is geared to students who want to know how python works and also to those totally new to programming.\n\nThe python language has very simple syntax(way to write it) to learn and it is one of the most powerful languages to learn since it can used for a variety of things.\n\nHere are some:\n\nData analysis\nGame development\nVisualization\nWeb development\nRobotics\nand more....\n\n\n\n\nJobs in this field are really lucrative and knowing this language will give you an edge when finding a job and making a lot more money than other developers; python developers are not as many as in other languages since people think is hard. Python is super easy to learn but very powerful since it contains many possibilities.\n\n\nPython is growing faster and faster everyday and it has surpassed many other languages over the years for a lot of reasons, which you will find out soon enough.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy take this course?\n\nThis course starts with explaining what programming really is? Have you ever wondered how things actually work in a program?\n\n1. Teaches the foundation of GENERAL programming\n\nEvery student should have some foundations on what programming really is before learning any language, why? Because once you understand the core components of programming it will be a lot easier to learn any language and create better programs.\n\n2. New lectures added all the time\n\nWhen you like what you do, it reflects. This is not a job for me, so I wake up wanting to code and help my students.

  "description": "Would you like to learn JavaScript and become a good earning front-end developer?\n\nSave your precious time by buying this course. You will learn how to program in JavaScript in a fast and easy way!\n\nThe total length of the JavaScript course is over 12 hours! You will learn theory and you will also gain lots of practice. During the course, I will explain to you how to write real-life applications, like galleries with thumbnails, image sliders, etc.\n\nI will do everything so that you understand JavaScript. After this course, you will always understand the code you are writing. You will understand all concepts and create your own applications!\n\nAfter my course, you can become a front-end developer. JavaScript is a very demanded language by employers.\n\nThe course is designed for people who don't have any knowledge about programming or want to truly understand JavaScript. It doesn't matter if you have never written any programs or you have no idea about programming... After my course, all this will change. You will bust the myth that programming is a difficult thing only for the few!\n\nJavaScript will bring life to your website.\n\nBy life, I mean inter-active, animated elements like: \n\ntooltips\n\nimage sliders\n\nforms with pre-validation\n\nslided panels\n\ngalleries with thumbnails\n\nmenus\n\nand many more\n\nLearn JavaScript in order to improve the user experience on your website, which will result in more visitors and sales, because happy visitors = a better reputation for your website.\n\nJavaScript gives your website additional functionalities that can be executed on the user's computer without re-connecting to the server. This allows you to do things that you cannot do with only HTML. Because of this, the user interface becomes more friendly and more inter-active\n\n\nJavascript is a programming language used for creating dynamic action on your website. If you want to remove/change/add content to your website dynamically, you must know JavaScript.\n\nAfter this course, you will know JavaScript perfectly. This is the most organised course about JavaScript from Beginner to Expert on the whole Internet. I will take you step by step from theory to practical examples, like image sliders and animation.\n\nUnderstanding JavaScript syntax well will allow you to also understand jQuery framework better. jQuery framework is a large library of useful JavaScript functions that allows you to write less code while at the same time accomplishing much more.\n\nWhat's more, JavaScript is required to understand AJAX which allows you to load content on your website without reloading the whole website.\n\n    As a front-end developer you have to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript perfectly.\n\nIn addition to this, I'm adding two BONUS sections about Debugging and Best practices for developing clean, easy to maintain and well-performing code in JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript is necessary for becoming a front-end developer. Imagine a situation where you have a clock on your website. You would need to request a new value from the server every second in order to update this clock. With JavaScript, everything runs on the user's end without re-connecting to the server. Just imagine what a mess it would be if the clock needed to reset every second. Your webpage would have to constantly reload to update the content, destroying the user experience. With JavaScript you can update the content without reloading the webpage. What's more is that there are advanced libraries for JavaScript, like AJAX, that allow you to connect to the database and retrieve information without reloading the website. To sum up JavaScript 'runs' on the web-browser of the visitor of your website.\n\nI give you 100% satisfaction. If you do not like my course, you can request a full refund up to 30 days. Remember that if you have any questions regarding topics covered in the course please feel free to ask. I'm always happy to help!\n\nOver 3000 people from around the world have enrolled in my courses\n\nMy courses are updated if needed\n\n\n\n\nPlease check out free lessons before buying! See for yourself the great quality of the course and enjoy it!\n\nBecome JavaScript Expert today!",
  "for_who": "This JavaScript course is meant for people who are familiar with HTML and CSS. No prior knowledge about JavaScript is needed. Everything is described from the beginning to expert level."

My approach is simple, hands-on, and relaxed.\n\n- - -\n\nSo stop wasting your time and money on courses & tutorials that don't deliver - and let's launch your career to new heights!\n\nJoin me on this journey, and I promise I won't let you down.\n\nSet yourself up for success, and I'll see you on the inside.\n\nYou won't regret it :)",

  "description": "In this Python Beyond the Basics - Object-Oriented Programming training course, expert author David Blaikie will teach you how to design Python classes, and how to implement object-oriented programming concepts in Python. This course is designed for users that already have a basic working knowledge of Python.\n\nYou will start by learning about classes, including defining a class, class attributes, and working with class and instance data. From there, David will teach you about inheritance and polymorphism. This video tutorial also covers advanced features, such as implementing core syntax, subclassing built-ins, and new style classes. You will also learn about exceptions and object serialization. Finally, David will teach you about efficiency and testing, including debugging, logging, and benchmarking.\n\nOnce you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of designing your own Python classes, as well as implementing object-oriented programming concepts in Python.",

Each component is then carefully unpacked through a process of visually understanding each characteristic and applying the 'code' to create the same.

I will guide you step by step, starting from the basics and always assuming you don't have previous programming experience or a computer science degree. In fact, most people who learn Python come from a wide variety of careers.\n\nThis course is designed to teach you Python and give you a real feel of how to use Python in a real environment. You will get this real-world Python experience by gaining free access to a remote server where Python is already installed. You will write and run Python programs directly on that remote computer in an easy fashion by simply using your internet browser. This will also allow you to run Python programs 24/7 on that server and let the apps do interesting tasks while you sleep. That will make you understand Python's real power in a real server environment, and I will guide you through the entire process.\n\nThe course is ideal for those who haven't programmed before. It also works for experienced programmers who don't know Python because the course offers you a training package so dense with information and practical activities you will not need to look further.\n\nBesides videos, you will also find a lot of Python exercises in the course. These are interactive exercises that you can solve directly on the Udemy exercise interface. The course also contains quizzes that will help you constantly check the knowledge you get during the videos. This variety of learning material will help you solidify your Python skills and give you a fun learning experience.\n\nThis course has all you need to get you started. After you take it, you will be ready to go to the next level of specializing in one of the Python fields, such as data science or web development. Python is one of the most needed skills nowadays.

  "description": "New! Updated for Spark 3, more hands-on exercises, and a stronger focus on DataFrames and Structured Streaming.\n\n“Big data\" analysis is a hot and highly valuable skill – and this course will teach you the hottest technology in big data: Apache Spark and specifically PySpark. Employers including Amazon, EBay, NASA JPL, and Yahoo all use Spark to quickly extract meaning from massive data sets across a fault-tolerant Hadoop cluster. You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home. It's easier than you might think.\n\nLearn and master the art of framing data analysis problems as Spark problems through over 20 hands-on examples, and then scale them up to run on cloud computing services in this course. You'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.\n\n\n\n\nLearn the concepts of Spark's DataFrames and Resilient Distributed Datastores\n\nDevelop and run Spark jobs quickly using Python and pyspark\n\nTranslate complex analysis problems into iterative or multi-stage Spark scripts\n\nScale up to larger data sets using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service\n\nUnderstand how Hadoop YARN distributes Spark across computing clusters\n\nLearn about other Spark technologies, like Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and GraphX\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be running code that analyzes gigabytes worth of information – in the cloud – in a matter of minutes. \n\nThis course uses the familiar Python programming language; if you'd rather use Scala to get the best performance out of Spark, see my \"Apache Spark with Scala - Hands On with Big Data\" course instead.\n\n\nWe'll have some fun along the way. You'll get warmed up with some simple examples of using Spark to analyze movie ratings data and text in a book. Once you've got the basics under your belt, we'll move to some more complex and interesting tasks. We'll use a million movie ratings to find movies that are similar to each other, and you might even discover some new movies you might like in the process! We'll analyze a social graph of superheroes, and learn who the most “popular\" superhero is – and develop a system to find “degrees of separation\" between superheroes. Are all Marvel superheroes within a few degrees of being connected to The Incredible Hulk? You'll find the answer.\n\nThis course is very hands-on; you'll spend most of your time following along with the instructor as we write, analyze, and run real code together – both on your own system, and in the cloud using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service. 7 hours of video content is included, with over 20 real examples of increasing complexity you can build, run and study yourself. Move through them at your own pace, on your own schedule. The course wraps up with an overview of other Spark-based technologies, including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and GraphX.\n\nWrangling big data with Apache Spark is an important skill in today's technical world. Enroll now!\n\n\n\n\n\" I studied \"Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python\" with Frank Kane, and helped me build a great platform for Big Data as a Service for my company. I recommend the course!  \" - Cleuton Sampaio De Melo Jr.",
  "for_who": "People with some software development background who want to learn the hottest technology in big data analysis will want to check this out. This course focuses on Spark from a software development standpoint; we introduce some machine learning and data mining concepts along the way, but that's not the focus. If you want to learn how to use Spark to carve up huge datasets and extract meaning from them, then this course is for you.\nIf you've never written a computer program or a script before, this course isn't for you - yet. I suggest starting with a Python course first, if programming is new to you.\nIf your software development job involves, or will involve, processing large amounts of data, you need to know about Spark.\nIf you're training for a new career in data science or big data, Spark is an important part of it."

  "description": "COMPLETELY REDONE WITH OVER 500 BRAND NEW VIDEOS!\n\nHi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2022 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:\n\nThis is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.\n\n94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.\n\nThe previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.\n\nEverything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!\n\nWe build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.\n\nThe course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.\n\nYou get to meet my cats and chickens!\n\nWhen you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.\n\nThroughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:\n\nHTML5\n\nCSS3\n\nFlexbox\n\nResponsive Design\n\nJavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)\n\nAsynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.\n\nAJAX and single page apps\n\nBootstrap 4 and 5 (alpha)\n\nSemanticUI\n\nBulma CSS Framework\n\nDOM Manipulation\n\nUnix(Command Line) Commands\n\nNodeJS\n\nNPM\n\nExpressJS\n\nTemplating\n\nREST\n\nSQL vs. NoSQL databases\n\nMongoDB\n\nDatabase Associations\n\nSchema Design\n\nMongoose\n\nAuthentication From Scratch\n\nCookies & Sessions\n\nAuthorization\n\nCommon Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc.\n\nDeveloper Best Practices\n\nDeploying Apps\n\nCloud Databases\n\nImage Upload and Storage\n\nMaps and Geocoding\n\nThis course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:\n\n\nLectures\n\nCode-Alongs\n\nProjects\n\nExercises\n\nResearch Assignments\n\nSlides\n\nDownloads\n\nReadings\n\nToo many pictures of my dog Rusty\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.  I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.  Sign up today and see how fun, exciting, and rewarding web development can be!",
  "for_who": "This course is for anyone who wants to learn about web development, regardless of previous experience\nIt's perfect for complete beginners with zero experience\nIt's also great for anyone who does have some experience in a few of the technologies(like HTML and CSS) but not all\nIf you want to take ONE COURSE to learn everything you need to know about web development, take this course"

  "description": "In only seven hours you will learn enough JavaScript to transform from a junior javascript developer into a senior javascript guru.\n\n\nYou will dramatically improve your chances of getting past a technical interview, landing that dream job and earning more money.\n\nIf you are like me you learnt Javascript by just muddling along, seeing what works and learning a thing or two every day.\n\nHowever, without a grasp of the deeper fundamentals, you will hit quite a few head scratchy issues, introduce bugs, find it hard to read and understand framework and library code and won’t be considered a senior developer.\n\nThis unique course teaches you advanced javascript knowledge through a series of interview questions, with regular quizzes on the way through to cement your knowledge.\n\nWhat are you going to learn?\n\nTypes & Equality: The different types in JS and how to check if two values are really equal?\n\nScopes: The different scopes a variable can be declared in and how to manipulate those scopes.\n\nDestructuring  & Looping: Did you know that JavaScript has for methods of looping over things?\n\nThis: We have a whole section dedicated to the this keyword. A deep understanding of the this keyword is core to becoming a senior JavaScript developer.\n\nObject Orientation: The history of OO in JavaScript from the Prototype Pattern to the Pseudo-Classical/Constructor Pattern all the way to the class syntax introduced in ES6. You need to know the previous patterns to truly understand the current class pattern.\n\nAsynchronous Programming: JavaScript power is in its asynchronicity, you will learn all about the pros and cons of callbacks, promises and async/await.\n\nAdvanced topics in Networking such as CORS and JSONP.\n\nAdvanced topics in Event Handling such as the different event phases.\n\nWhy an interview format?\n\n\nI find that it's only when I'm facing an upcoming interview that I get into gear and really make sure I have a deep understanding of what I claim to know.\n\nI might know the best practice for how to solve a problem, but do I know why?\n\nJavascript interviews are designed to dig deeper into your knowledge of a subject, see if you are just mimicking what you have read or if you have a proper understanding.\n\nAlso, it's FUN, what's more satisfying than learning something, then passing a test!",
  "for_who": "Maybe your a JS developer looking to change jobs and isn’t looking forward to the interview, I mean who does?\nMaybe it’s been a while since you wrote JS and you want to get a refresher on the latest features.\nMaybe you just finished another Beginner or Intermediate JavaScript course and want to get to the next level\nJust about to enter the job market after a career change\nNew graduates coming out of university"

  "description": "New! Updated with extra content on generative models: variational auto-encoders (VAE's) and generative adversarial models (GAN's)\n\nMachine Learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere; if you want to know how companies like Google, Amazon, and even Udemy extract meaning and insights from massive data sets, this data science course will give you the fundamentals you need. Data Scientists enjoy one of the top-paying jobs, with an average salary of $120,000 according to Glassdoor and Indeed. That's just the average! And it's not just about money - it's interesting work too!\n\nIf you've got some programming or scripting experience, this course will teach you the techniques used by real data scientists and machine learning practitioners in the tech industry - and prepare you for a move into this hot career path. This comprehensive machine learning tutorial includes over 100 lectures spanning 15 hours of video, and most topics include hands-on Python code examples you can use for reference and for practice. I’ll draw on my 9 years of experience at Amazon and IMDb to guide you through what matters, and what doesn’t.\n\nEach concept is introduced in plain English, avoiding confusing mathematical notation and jargon. It’s then demonstrated using Python code you can experiment with and build upon, along with notes you can keep for future reference. You won't find academic, deeply mathematical coverage of these algorithms in this course - the focus is on practical understanding and application of them. At the end, you'll be given a final project to apply what you've learned!\n\n\nThe topics in this course come from an analysis of real requirements in data scientist job listings from the biggest tech employers. We'll cover the A-Z of machine learning, AI, and data mining techniques real employers are looking for, including:\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning / Neural Networks (MLP's, CNN's, RNN's) with TensorFlow and Keras\n\nCreating synthetic images with Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE's) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's)\n\nData Visualization in Python with MatPlotLib and Seaborn\n\nTransfer Learning\n\nSentiment analysis\n\nImage recognition and classification\n\nRegression analysis\n\nK-Means Clustering\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis\n\nTrain/Test and cross validation\n\nBayesian Methods\n\nDecision Trees and Random Forests\n\nMultiple Regression\n\nMulti-Level Models\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nCollaborative Filtering\n\nK-Nearest Neighbor\n\nBias/Variance Tradeoff\n\nEnsemble Learning\n\nTerm Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency\n\nExperimental Design and A/B Tests\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nHyperparameter Tuning\n\n\n...and much more! There's also an entire section on machine learning with Apache Spark, which lets you scale up these techniques to \"big data\" analyzed on a computing cluster.\n\nIf you're new to Python, don't worry - the course starts with a crash course. If you've done some programming before, you should pick it up quickly. This course shows you how to get set up on Microsoft Windows-based PC's, Linux desktops, and Macs.\n\nIf you’re a programmer looking to switch into an exciting new career track, or a data analyst looking to make the transition into the tech industry – this course will teach you the basic techniques used by real-world industry data scientists. These are topics any successful technologist absolutely needs to know about, so what are you waiting for? Enroll now!\n\n\n\n\n\"I started doing your course... Eventually I got interested and never thought that I will be working for corporate before a friend offered me this job. I am learning a lot which was impossible to learn in academia and enjoying it thoroughly. To me, your course is the one that helped me understand how to work with corporate problems. How to think to be a success in corporate AI research. I find you the most impressive instructor in ML, simple yet convincing.\" - Kanad Basu, PhD\n\n\n",
  "for_who": "Software developers or programmers who want to transition into the lucrative data science and machine learning career path will learn a lot from this course.\nTechnologists curious about how deep learning really works\nData analysts in the finance or other non-tech industries who want to transition into the tech industry can use this course to learn how to analyze data using code instead of tools. But, you'll need some prior experience in coding or scripting to be successful.\nIf you have no prior coding or scripting experience, you should NOT take this course - yet. Go take an introductory Python course first."

  "description": "This course will get you started in building your FIRST artificial neural network using deep learning techniques. Following my previous course on logistic regression, we take this basic building block, and build full-on non-linear neural networks right out of the gate using Python and Numpy. All the materials for this course are FREE.\n\nWe extend the previous binary classification model to multiple classes using the softmax function, and we derive the very important training method called \"backpropagation\" using first principles. I show you how to code backpropagation in Numpy, first \"the slow way\", and then \"the fast way\" using Numpy features.\n\nNext, we implement a neural network using Google's new TensorFlow library.\n\nYou should take this course if you are interested in starting your journey toward becoming a master at deep learning, or if you are interested in machine learning and data science in general. We go beyond basic models like logistic regression and linear regression and I show you something that automatically learns features.\n\nThis course provides you with many practical examples so that you can really see how deep learning can be used on anything. Throughout the course, we'll do a course project, which will show you how to predict user actions on a website given user data like whether or not that user is on a mobile device, the number of products they viewed, how long they stayed on your site, whether or not they are a returning visitor, and what time of day they visited.\n\nAnother project at the end of the course shows you how you can use deep learning for facial expression recognition. Imagine being able to predict someone's emotions just based on a picture!\n\nAfter getting your feet wet with the fundamentals, I provide a brief overview of some of the newest developments in neural networks - slightly modified architectures and what they are used for.\n\nNOTE:\n\n\nIf you already know about softmax and backpropagation, and you want to skip over the theory and speed things up using more advanced techniques along with GPU-optimization, check out my follow-up course on this topic, Data Science: Practical Deep Learning Concepts in Theano and TensorFlow.\n\nI have other courses that cover more advanced topics, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoders, and more! But you want to be very comfortable with the material in this course before moving on to more advanced subjects.\n\nThis course focuses on \"how to build and understand\", not just \"how to use\". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about \"remembering facts\", it's about \"seeing for yourself\" via experimentation. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want more than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.\n\n\n\"If you can't implement it, you don't understand it\"\n\nOr as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".\n\nMy courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch\n\nOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?\n\nAfter doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Prerequisites:\n\ncalculus (taking derivatives)\n\nmatrix arithmetic\n\nprobability\n\nPython coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets\n\nNumpy coding: matrix and vector operations, loading a CSV file\n\nBe familiar with basic linear models such as linear regression and logistic regression\n\n\n\n\nWHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:\n\nCheck out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)",
  "for_who": "Students interested in machine learning - you'll get all the tidbits you need to do well in a neural networks course\nProfessionals who want to use neural networks in their machine learning and data science pipeline. Be able to apply more powerful models, and know its drawbacks."

This is just the perfect recipe for students who have little or no knowledge of the technologies required to develop websites. (It also helps the students who know them). The one thing that impressed me a lot was the motto - Learn by Doing. I personally knew these technologies as I had studied them in college but I really learned them while doing this course!! And there's the difference. The practical hands on knowledge is really helpful. Kudos! Keep up the good work :).” -Veeresh Kamble\n\n\n",

  "description": "This course was completely redesigned in November of 2019 to match the demands and trends of the industry.\n\nYou already understand the basics of HTML and CSS, but you don’t necessarily feel qualified for the web developer jobs you want. In this course we’ll bridge that gap by building a mobile-first responsive website, together, step-by-step. Along the way we’ll learn the modern skill-set that companies are looking for in developers.\n\nI know what companies are looking for because as a senior developer I’ve been on the hiring side of job interviews. Every time we passed on a candidate I’d think to myself “It would be nice if we could point them towards a course that taught the exact skill set we’re looking for.”\n\nI couldn’t find a course like that - so I built this one.\n\nBy the end of this course you’ll be able to build sites using the modern skills, tools, and best-practices that companies need in developers.\n\nTake your developer career to the next level by:\n\nLearning Git, GitHub, and command-line basics to collaborate with other developers and deploy your sites live up onto the web.\n\nLeveraging Node.js tools like NPM and webpack to save time by automating tasks.\n\nEnhancing your CSS knowledge with techniques (BEM & PostCSS) to keep your styles super-organized and manageable even on larger sites.\n\nSpeeding up your sites with the mobile-first performance philosophy.\n\nUnderstanding JavaScript basics like Object-oriented Programming, and how to write well-structured code using the ES6 module pattern (Babel & webpack).\n\nUsing the Netlify service to not only host your website but also learn the very basics of cloud (or AWS Lambda) functions.\n\nDiscovering tips to get more job interviews, do well in interviews, and continually progress in your career (avoid burnout & stagnation).\n\n\nThis course may be brand new, but this isn’t my first time teaching. I’ve led trainings for Fortune 500 companies, and I’ve already helped over 7,000 people on Udemy and received the following feedback:\n\n\n\"Brad definitely has some of the best techniques to embed the lesson into your mind… hands down these are the best tutorials I have had the opportunity to view.\"\n\n\n\"Presentation is concise without being tedious… you honestly feel that you have a thorough understanding of the subject.\"\n\n\n\"…[Brad] explained the process. Not memorize this or that, he explained the process. If you're looking to take a course to understand the foundations of creating websites, look no further.\"\n\n\nI've been teaching for the better part of a decade and I consider this course my magnum opus. This is the course I wish I could have taken several years ago.\n\nBecome highly valuable and relevant to the companies that are hiring web developers; in one convenient place alongside one instructor. If you're ready to begin your transformation - I'll see you on the inside!",
  "for_who": "You'll benefit from this course if you're looking to bridge the gap between what you currently know (HTML & CSS) and what hiring companies want you to know."

These are often found quilting & paper cutting. Colouring pencils & pens and paints are optional."

  "description": "In this course I demonstrate how to construct five Islamic Geometric Patterns step by step using the traditional method of a compass and straight edge.I will also provide you with a DOWNLOADABLE Step-by-Step handout PDF file for each pattern to supplement the video demonstrations.\n\nIn each unit you will learn to construct an underlying grid and outline an Islamic geometric pattern. This course consists of four units:\n\n- A Sixfold Pattern: The Star and Hexagon\n\n- An Eightfold Pattern: The Khatam * PLUS* additional pattern variations\n\n- A Sixfold Pattern: The Ferozkoh Jaali\n\n- An Eighfold Pattern: The Geometric Rosette\n\nPLUS one final bonus unit: UNIT 5: a DOWNLOADABLE Step-by-Step handout PDF for drawing a:\n\nChinese Qur'anic Manuscript Arcing Motif\n\n\nYou will also learn additional techniques:\n\n- Tiling the pattern, for both fourfold and and sixfold patterns;\n\n- Creating a ribbon effect to interlace the pattern;\n\n- Transferring the pattern using tracing paper and a spoon;\n\n- Adding colour using watercolour pencils and an aquabrush.\n\nDepending on your pace, each pattern may take 10 to 20 minutes to construct. The interlacing and tiling will take longer. As you work through the course, you will develop your compass and ruler and construction skills. Each pattern is a level up from the previous.\n\nYou will need a compass, ruler, pencil, plain paper, tracing paper, eraser and masking tape.  I also use watercolour pencils and an aquabrush. However, you will gain enough skills to be able to transfer a pattern to the surface of your choice - how you add the colour is up to you, colouring pens or pencils, paints and beyond!\n\nThis course is aimed at beginners with an interest in the geometric patterns they have seen in and around the Islamic world and beyond. Many people haven't used a compass since their school days, if that's you, you can rediscover all the potential it holds.\n\nAll the videos on this course feature a remixed version of the song \"Montmartre\" by Jahzzar, from the Free Music Archive used under CC BY-SA 3.0",
  "for_who": "Suitable for beginners particularly those who have an interest in pattern, symmetry and geometry.\nIf you have previous experience of constructing patterns, do have a look at the four patterns on this course as they may be familar to you already and therefore this course isnt for you."

  "description": "*** The #1 bestselling JavaScript course on Udemy! ***\n\n*** Just updated for latest ES2021 and ES2022 features ***\n\n\"Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer\" — Carson Bartholomew\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.\n\nThat's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this the right JavaScript course for you?\n\nThis is the most complete JavaScript course on Udemy. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.\n\nYou will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.\n\nYou will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.\n\nAnd unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!\n\nBut... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's \"The Complete JavaScript Course\". In fact, it's like many courses in one! But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.\n\n\n\n\nWhy am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?\n\nMy name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 4000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.\n\nRecently, I took all my teaching experience to build this new and greatly improved JavaScript course. It's now the best and most in-depth JavaScript course that you will find on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet).\n\nI know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.\n\n\n\n\nSo what exactly is covered in the course?\n\nBuild 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns\n\nMaster the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more\n\nLearn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more\n\nHow JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.\n\nDeep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.\n\nDeep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]\n\nDeep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]\n\nLearn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules\n\nCheck out the course curriculum for an even more detailed overview of the content :)\n\n\n\n\nThis is what's also included in the package:\n\nUp-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy for Business students)\n\nProfessional English captions (not the auto-generated ones)\n\nDownloadable starter code and final code for each section\n\nDownloadable slides for 40+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)\n\nFree support in the course Q&A\n\n25+ coding challenges and 25+ assignments to practice your new skills (solutions included)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is for you if...\n\n... you want to gain a true and deep understanding of JavaScript\n\n... you have been trying to learn JavaScript but: 1) still don't really understand JavaScript, or 2) still don't feel confident to code real apps\n\n... you are interested in using a library/framework like React, Angular, Vue, or Node.js in the future\n\n... you already know JavaScript and are looking for an advanced course. This course includes expert topics!\n\n... you want to get started with programming: JavaScript is a great first language!\n\n\n\n\nDoes any of these look like you? If so, then start this adventure today, and join me and 4000+ other developers in the only JavaScript course that you will ever need!",
  "for_who": "Take this course if you want to gain a true and deep understanding of JavaScript\nTake this course if you have been trying to learn JavaScript but: 1) still don't really understand JavaScript, or 2) still don't feel confident to code real apps\nTake this course if you're interested in using a library/framework like React, Angular, Vue or Node in the future\nTake this course if you already know JavaScript and are looking for an advanced course.

Arrow Functions? Of course. Rest/Spread Operator? Included! And every other new piece of syntax!\n\nMastering ES6 syntax can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of modern web frameworks like React and Angular 2.\n\nThis course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build applications using each new piece of Javascript syntax introduced with ES6.\n\nWe'll start by mastering the fundamentals of iteration over Arrays using helpers like 'forEach', 'map', and 'reduce'.  After an introduction to Array helpers, we'll dive right in to advanced ES6, covering topics like enhanced object literals, default function arguments, and classes.  Every topic includes multiple live code exercises to ensure you understand each new concept.\n\nIf you are new to Javascript or ES6, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the Javascript course for you! To learn ES6 you have to understand it and comprehend exactly why each piece of syntax was added to the language\n\nLearn the purpose of Babel and why ES6 was created\nMaster the process of refactoring your current ES5 code into super-charged ES6\nGrasp the difference between the 'rest' and 'spread' operators\nDevelop complex applications that scale in complexity by mastering advanced ES6 design patterns\nDive deeper into iteration using generators.  No fancy terms required!\n\nI've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning ES6. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.",

  "description": "60%+ of people who try to learn how to program end up quitting.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs it because \"programming just isn't for everyone\"?\n\nOr is it because only those with experience in hard sciences can learn it?\n\nNo, neither of those are true. It's simply due to the fact that the vast majority of people who try don't have a basic understanding of the technology they're going to use. \n\nHow exactly can you tackle responsive design if you don't know how a browser works?\n\nHow are you going to create a desktop application if you don't know what makes your computer freeze constantly (besides porn, obviously)?\n\nHow are you going to hide your confused facial expression the next time your site's server crashes because of a \"node socket problem\" in your full stack Javascript?\n\nIf you've ever taken your computer to a technician and said \"Make it work\" or \"It don't work good. Me cry\" then you're exactly who needs this course.\n\nOver the next 10 years the United States is expected to add over 2 million programming jobs. Jobs that pay well over $1000 a year. And that's just the United States (Merica').\n\nSo if you're trying to jump on the coding gravy train, put down your bronze statuette of Elon Musk standing on Mars, and start filling in the gaps in your \"tech literacy\". Even if you yourself do not become a \"coding ninja\" yourself all the future coding ninjas you work with with thank you (and tell you to stop calling them coding ninjas).\n\nAbout your instructor:\n\nHi, I'm Evan Kimbrell. I too struggled to learn the basics of programming. If failing to program were a sport, I'd be on the Dream Team. \n\nToday, I run a web and mobile development agency called Sprintkick and over the last 4 years we've built and managed over 100+ web & mobile applications. \n\nHow does one so technologically challenged manage to pull this off? Well, first off I would disagree with \"technologically challenged\" (come on) and second it was actually straight forward. I just had to spend a concerted amount of time learning what I needed to know about basic computer, web, and programming technology as well as modern technology trends and advanced concepts. \n\nThis course is an accelerated path designed to get you to \"I get it\" and finally start communicating correctly & effectively about technology.\n\n\n",
  "for_who": "Anyone interested in learning how to program that is already struggling or intimidated by the process\nAnyone who wants to better communicate with development teams they work with\nAnyone who wants to hire, vet, & manage developers more effectively\nAnyone who is simply interested in getting an in depth understanding of modern web & mobile technology trends"

  "description": "Course Most Recently Updated Nov/2018! \n\nThank you all for the huge response to this emerging course!  We are delighted to have over 20,000 students in over 160 different countries.  I'm genuinely touched by the overwhelmingly positive and thoughtful reviews.  It's such a privilege to share and introduce this important topic with everyday people in a clear and understandable way. \n\nI'm also excited to announce that I have created real closed captions for all course material, so weather you need them due to a hearing impairment, or find it easier to follow long (great for ESL students!)... I've got you covered. \n\nMost importantly:\n\nTo make this course \"real\", we've expanded.  In November of 2018, the course went from 41 lectures and 8 sections, to 62 lectures and 15 sections!  We hope you enjoy the new content!  \n\n\n\n\nUnlock the secrets of understanding Machine Learning for Data Science!\n\nIn this introductory course, the “Backyard Data Scientist” will guide you through wilderness of Machine Learning for Data Science.  Accessible to everyone, this introductory course not only explains Machine Learning, but where it fits in the “techno sphere around us”, why it’s important now, and how it will dramatically change our world today and for days to come.\n\nOur exotic journey will include the core concepts of:\n\nThe train wreck definition of computer science and one that will actually instead make sense.   \n\nAn explanation of data that will have you seeing data everywhere that you look!  \n\nOne of the “greatest lies” ever sold about the future computer science.  \n\nA genuine explanation of Big Data, and how to avoid falling into the marketing hype.  \n\nWhat is Artificial intelligence?  Can a computer actually think?  How do computers do things like navigate like a GPS or play games anyway?  \n\nWhat is Machine Learning?  And if a computer can think – can it learn?   \n\nWhat is Data Science, and how it relates to magical unicorns!  \n\nHow Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data and Data Science interrelate to one another. \n\nWe’ll then explore the past and the future while touching on the importance, impacts and examples of Machine Learning for Data Science:\n\nHow a perfect storm of data, computer and Machine Learning algorithms have combined together to make this important right now.  \n\nWe’ll actually make sense of how computer technology has changed over time while covering off a journey from 1956 to 2014.  Do you have a super computer in your home?  You might be surprised to learn the truth.  \n\nWe’ll discuss the kinds of problems Machine Learning solves, and visually explain regression, clustering and classification in a way that will intuitively make sense.  \n\nMost importantly we’ll show how this is changing our lives.  Not just the lives of business leaders, but most importantly…you too!\n\nTo make sense of the Machine part of Machine Learning, we’ll explore the Machine Learning process:\n\nHow do you solve problems with Machine Learning and what are five things you must do to be successful?  \n\nHow to ask the right question, to be solved by Machine Learning.  \n\nIdentifying, obtaining and preparing the right data … and dealing with dirty data!  \n\nHow every mess is “unique” but that tidy data is like families!   \n\nHow to identify and apply Machine Learning algorithms, with exotic names like “Decision Trees”, “Neural Networks” “K’s Nearest Neighbors” and “Naive Bayesian Classifiers”  \n\nAnd the biggest pitfalls to avoid and how to tune your Machine Learning models to help ensure a successful result for Data Science.\n\nOur final section of the course will prepare you to begin your future journey into Machine Learning for Data Science after the course is complete.  We’ll explore:\n\n\nHow to start applying Machine Learning without losing your mind.  \n\nWhat equipment Data Scientists use, (the answer might surprise you!)  \n\nThe top five tools Used for data science, including some surprising ones.   \n\nAnd for each of the top five tools – we’ll explain what they are, and how to get started using them.   \n\nAnd we’ll close off with some cautionary tales, so you can be the most successful you can be in applying Machine Learning to Data Science problems.\n\nBonus Course!  To make this “really real”, I’ve included a bonus course!\n\nMost importantly in the bonus course I’ll include information at the end of every section titled “Further Magic to Explore” which will help you to continue your learning experience. \n\nIn this bonus course we’ll explore:\n\nCreating a real live Machine Learning Example of Titanic proportions.  That’s right – we are going to predict survivability onboard the Titanic!\n\nUse Anaconda Jupyter and python 3.x\n\nA crash course in python - covering all the core concepts of Python you need to make sense of code examples that follow. See the included free cheat sheet!\n\nHands on running Python! (Interactively, with scripts, and with Jupyter)\n\nBasics of how to use Jupyter Notebooks\n\nReviewing and reinforcing core concepts of Machine Learning (that we’ll soon apply!)\n\nFoundations of essential Machine Learning and Data Science modules:\n\nNumPy – An Array Implementation\n\nPandas – The Python Data Analysis Library\n\nMatplotlib – A plotting library which produces quality figures in a variety of formats\n\nSciPy – The fundamental Package for scientific computing in Python\n\nScikit-Learn – Simple and efficient tools data mining, data analysis, and Machine Learning\n\nIn the titanic hands on example we’ll follow all the steps of the Machine Learning workflow throughout:\n\n1. Asking the right question.\n\n2. Identifying, obtaining, and preparing the right data\n\n3. Identifying and applying a Machine Learning algorithm\n\n4. Evaluating the performance of the model and adjusting\n\n5. Using and presenting the model\n\nWe’ll also see a real world example of problems in Machine learning, including underfit and overfit.\n\nThe bonus course finishes with a conclusion and further resources to continue your Machine Learning journey. \n\nSo I invite you to join me, the Backyard Data Scientist on an exquisite journey into unlocking the secrets of Machine Learning for Data Science.... for you know - everyday people... like you!\n\nSign up right now, and we'll see you – on the other side!\n",

  "description": "Are you interested in a career in Data Science or Data Analytics?\n\nIn that case, inevitably you are going to encounter databases in your work.\n\nBut how do you interact with databases?\n\nThe answer is simple: SQL \n\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language and this is one of the main tools used to organize databases, input data into them and extract it on request.\n\nIn this course you will learn how to create queries in a popular variation of SQL called PostgreSQL. \n\nAnd even if at your workplace you are using a different variation (e.g. Oracle, SQL Server or MySQL), you will find that the skills you learn in this course are easily transferable.\n\nBut there are many SQL courses out there, so the question is:\n\nWhat makes this course stand out?\n\nThe unique advantage of this course is that in addition to learning SQL you will also master the concepts of Database Design.\n\nWe will cover off topics such as:\n\n\n- OLAP vs OLTP databases (Online Analytics Processing & Online Transaction Processing): you will understand exactly how and why the designs of these two types of Databases differ\n\n\n- Normalization of Databases: we will show you the theory behind normalization AND together we will practice how to normalize a Database step-by-step\n\nWhy is that important?\n\nKnowing how databases are designed is not a compulsory skill to have for a Data Scientist / Analyst. However, it's a HUGE added benefit.\n\nThese skills will allow you to better interact with databases and derive results and extract insights from your data faster.\n\nThis course is designed with the Data Scientists and Analysts in mind, so if you want to propel your Data Science career, then this course is for you!\n\nWe look forward to seeing you inside,\n\nKirill & Ilya",

Right next to it, on the same sheet of paper, analyze and replicate the curved line you just drew by translating it into straight lines and angles as you saw demonstrated. Remember to start by figuring out the relationship between the starting and stopping points of the line.</p>\n\n<p>Project #2 On one side of a sheet of paper draw a curving shape. Right next to it, on the same sheet of paper, analyze and replicate the shape you just drew by translating it into straight lines and angles as you saw demonstrated.</p>\n\n<p>Project #3 Draw 100 Freestyle forms using light lines. You can draw any shape we’ve drawn so far, and combine them together to create a wide range of various complex shapes. Remember to draw lightly and fluidly while drawing with the entire arm!</p>",

You’ll be introduced to two sets of ideas that will give you a sense of the drawing process as a whole. Here they are:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>The Three Principles of Drawing.</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your Drawings Should Go From:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Light Lines to Dark Lines.</li><li>Big Shapes to Small Shapes.</li><li>General Information to Specifics.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>The 5 Questions</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before drawing you will go through these 5 questions:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the biggest shape?</li><li>What is its axis?</li><li>How big should it be?</li><li>Where on the page should it go?</li><li>(After making your first attempt) Are there any changes I can make? If the answer is yes, (it almost always is), make any necessary adjustments to the form. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t criticize yourself for not getting it right the first time! Once you’re satisfied with the shape, repeat the 5 questions with one small change to the first question:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the <em>next</em> biggest shape?</li></ul>",

Just like anything and everything you have learned you had to know the very basics. You can't do math without knowing how to count and you can't drive without knowing what the key looks like.\n\nThis course is your \"key\". All drawing starts with lines, some are straight, some are curved and rough but all are lines.  Lines are used to make shapes and shapes become volumes (3d shapes) and everything in the world is made from shapes. \n\nI will teach you to use those shapes. I will show you how to make lines shapes and volumes. You will learn to hone your observational skills and draw what you see, and even what is in your head if you study and practice enough.\n\nYou need no experience in drawing. Absolutely zero ! There is no special software just a regular pencil and some paper. \n\nIf you have always wanted to learn to draw this is the course for you. If you are a graphic artist that knows learning to draw will save you time and money, take this course. If you want to make comics or cartoons then this will be the course that will be your starting point. \n\nThis is the beginner class. Often books tell you to start by making 3d shapes but what if you are having trouble with that? If you are , I got you covered.  \n\n ",

  "description": "*** I am truly honored Udemy CEO highlighted my SAA-C03 courses in the recent earnings call [Aug-2022] for providing up-to-date and relevant content ***\n\nWelcome to the Part 1 AWS Solutions Architect Associate Course!\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a cloud architect, you have come to the right place!\n\nAn architect is responsible for translating the business requirements into a solution blueprint\n\nAnd also provide implementation guidance to the development team\n\nTo effectively play this role, you need a breadth of understanding of AWS services and how to integrate them into a complete solution\n\nIn this course, we walk through several business scenarios and how to apply cloud architectural principles\n\nSuch as avoiding a single point of failure, properly securing and protecting your workload, designing for high availability, and so forth\n\nI am Chandra Lingam, and I am your instructor.\n\nI have structured the curriculum into two courses\n\nThe first course (this one) covers infrastructure services such as network, server, monitoring, storage, load balancers, auto-scaling, cloud security, S3, managing your application traffic flow with services such as Route 53, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and we wrap up with migrate your application to the cloud\n\nThe second course (this one) covers messaging services, lambda, API Gateway, databases, containers, cloudformation, and disaster recovery concepts\n\nHere is the approximate time you need to plan to spend on preparation.\n\nThe first course is around 15 hours long and the second course is around 9 hours long\n\nI recommend adjusting the video playback speed to 1.25x\n\nSo, you can watch all the videos in around 20 hours\n\nAnd for the hands-on labs and quizzes, add another 20 hours\n\nSo, plan to spend at least 40 hours on preparation\n\nThe time will vary based on your experience – but you can use this as a ballpark\n\nI also provide PDFs to review specific concepts quickly\n\nSomething unique I offer my students is the weekly study group sessions where you can meet fellow learners and discuss specific topics\n\nWith the knowledge you gain in this course, you will become a really good architect and easily clear the certification exam!\n\nI am looking forward to meeting you!",

  "description": "*** I am truly honored Udemy CEO highlighted my SAA-C03 courses in the recent earnings call [Aug-2022] for providing up-to-date and relevant content ***\n\nWelcome to the Part 2 of AWS Solutions Architect Associate Course!\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a cloud architect, you have come to the right place!\n\nAn architect is responsible for translating the business requirements into a solution blueprint\n\nAnd also provide implementation guidance to the development team\n\nTo effectively play this role, you need a breadth of understanding of AWS services and how to integrate them into a complete solution\n\nIn this course, we walk through several business scenarios and how to apply cloud architectural principles\n\nSuch as avoiding a single point of failure, properly securing and protecting your workload, designing for high availability, and so forth\n\nI am Chandra Lingam, and I am your instructor.\n\nI have structured the curriculum into two courses\n\nThe first course covers infrastructure services such as network, server, monitoring, storage, load balancers, auto-scaling, cloud security, S3, managing your application traffic flow with services such as Route 53, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and we wrap up with migrate your application to the cloud\n\nThe second course (this one) covers messaging services, lambda, API Gateway, databases, containers, cloudformation, and disaster recovery concepts\n\nHere is the approximate time you need to plan to spend on preparation.\n\nThe first course is around 15 hours long and the second course is around 9 hours long\n\nI recommend adjusting the video playback speed to 1.25x\n\nSo, you can watch all the videos in around 20 hours\n\nAnd for the hands-on labs and quizzes, add another 20 hours\n\nSo, plan to spend at least 40 hours on preparation\n\nThe time will vary based on your experience – but you can use this as a ballpark\n\nI also provide PDFs to review specific concepts quickly\n\nSomething unique I offer my students is the weekly study group sessions where you can meet fellow learners and discuss specific topics\n\nWith the knowledge you gain in this course, you will become a really good architect and easily clear the certification exam!\n\nI am looking forward to meeting you!",

  "description": "ALL COURSE CONTENTS UPDATED FOR NEW VERSION OF EXAM\n\nSome of the great reviews for this course which really means you just have to take this course\n\n1. Really good courses overall will really help you achieved your goal in AWS !!!!\n\n2. Of the 4 courses I have on AWS on udemy, this is the best of them all. This course is packed with details. Great explanation of both concepts and theory followed by walk-through. Good use of visual diagrams, which are white-board drawn in a good visible size. Also mention of tips I found very useful, and good coverage of all the things required. I also found it engaging throughout.\n\n3. Good job done Alan Rodrigues... It is very nice for the people who would like to appear for the exam.\n\nThe AWS Solution Architect is one of the most sought after certifications in the IT industry today. The average salary of an employee also increases after they have obtained the AWS Solution Architect Exam. Hence this certification  is looked upon as the crown jewels of certifications.\n\n\nThis Course is designed to help students pass their AWS Solution Architect Exam. This course has an in-depth look into all of the essential AWS services and how they work together. \n\nIn order to design this course , the instructor has taken the re-certification on the AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam MULTIPLE TIMES to ensure the right topics are discussed in the course.\n\n\nThe Lecture videos in the course is designed to provide a better one to one interaction with the student. The idea is that the student leaves with a better understanding of the concept before going into the demo chapters of the same concept.\n\nThe Course is split into Logical sections and has the desired flow that helps the student understand the interaction and connection between the different services offered by AWS. \n\nThis Course has Lectures and Demo's on key AWS Services such as EC2 , Elastic Load balancer , Simple Notification Service, the Simple Queue Service , Cloudformation etc.\n\n\nThis Course is ideal for any Student who wants to take the latest AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam.\n",

  "description": "Complete Guide to Practical Data Science with Python: Learn Statistics, Visualization, Machine Learning & More\n\nTHIS IS A COMPLETE DATA SCIENCE TRAINING WITH PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS: \n\nIt's A Full 12-Hour Python Data Science BootCamp To Help You Learn Statistical Modelling, Data Visualization, Machine Learning & Basic Deep Learning In Python! \n\nHERE IS WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE:\n\nFirst of all, this course a complete guide to practical data science using Python...\n\nThat means, this course covers ALL the aspects of practical data science and if you take this course alone, you can do away with taking other courses or buying books on Python-based data science.  \n\nIn this age of big data, companies across the globe use Python to sift through the avalanche of information at their disposal. By storing, filtering, managing, and manipulating data in Python, you can give your company a competitive edge & boost your career to the next level!\n\nTHIS IS MY PROMISE TO YOU:\n\nCOMPLETE THIS ONE COURSE & BECOME A PRO IN PRACTICAL PYTHON BASED DATA SCIENCE!\n\nBut, first things first, My name is MINERVA SINGH and I am an Oxford University MPhil (Geography and Environment), graduate. I recently finished a PhD at Cambridge University (Tropical Ecology and Conservation).\n\nI have several years of experience in analyzing real-life data from different sources using data science-related techniques and producing publications for international peer-reviewed journals.\n\nOver the course of my research, I realized almost all the Python data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic and use data science interchangeably with machine learning...\n\nThis gives the student an incomplete knowledge of the subject. This course will give you a robust grounding in all aspects of data science, from statistical modelling to visualization to machine learning.\n\nUnlike other Python instructors, I dig deep into the statistical modelling features of Python and gives you a one-of-a-kind grounding in Python Data Science!\n\nYou will go all the way from carrying out simple visualizations and data explorations to statistical analysis to machine learning to finally implementing simple deep learning-based models using Python\n\nDISCOVER 12 COMPLETE SECTIONS ADDRESSING EVERY ASPECT OF PYTHON DATA SCIENCE (INCLUDING):\n\n• A full introduction to Python Data Science and powerful Python driven framework for data science, Anaconda\n• Getting started with Jupyter notebooks for implementing data science techniques in Python\n• A comprehensive presentation about basic analytical tools- Numpy Arrays, Operations, Arithmetic, Equation-solving, Matrices, Vectors, Broadcasting, etc.\n• Data Structures and Reading in Pandas, including CSV, Excel, JSON, HTML data\n• How to Pre-Process and “Wrangle” your Python data by removing NAs/No data, handling conditional data, grouping by attributes, etc.\n• Creating data visualizations like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, bar plots, pie/line charts, and more!\n• Statistical analysis, statistical inference, and the relationships between variables\n• Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning in Python\n• You’ll even discover how to create artificial neural networks and deep learning structures...& MUCH MORE!\n\nWith this course, you’ll have the keys to the entire Python Data Science kingdom!\n\nNO PRIOR PYTHON OR STATISTICS/MACHINE LEARNING KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED:\n\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most valuable Python Data Science basics and techniques...\n\nI use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts in Python.\n\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement Python-based data science in real life.\n\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to work with real data in Python.\n\nYou’ll even understand deep concepts like statistical modelling in Python’s Statsmodels package and the difference between statistics and machine learning (including hands-on techniques).\n\nI will even introduce you to deep learning and neural networks using the powerful H2o framework!\n\nWith this Powerful All-In-One Python Data Science course, you’ll know it all: visualization, stats, machine learning, data mining, and deep learning! \n\nThe underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can apply Python-based data science on real data and put into practice today. Start analyzing data for your own projects, whatever your skill level and IMPRESS your potential employers with actual examples of your data science abilities.\n\nHERE IS WHAT THIS COURSE WILL DO FOR YOU:\n\nThis course is your one shot way of acquiring the knowledge of statistical data analysis skills that I acquired from the rigorous training received at two of the best universities in the world, a perusal of numerous books and publishing statistically rich papers in renowned international journal like PLOS One.\n\nThis course will:\n\n   (a) Take students without a prior Python and/or statistics background from a basic level to performing some of the most common advanced data science techniques using the powerful Python-based Jupyter notebooks.\n\n   (b) Equip students to use Python for performing different statistical data analysis and visualization tasks for data modelling.\n\n   (c) Introduce some of the most important statistical and machine learning concepts to students in a practical manner such that students can apply these concepts for practical data analysis and interpretation.\n\n   (d) Students will get a strong background in some of the most important data science techniques.\n\n   (e) Students will be able to decide which data science techniques are best suited to answer their research questions and applicable to their data and interpret the results.\n\nIt is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend some time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts related to data science. However, the majority of the course will focus on implementing different techniques on real data and interpret the results. After each video, you will learn a new concept or technique which you may apply to your own projects. \n\nJOIN THE COURSE NOW!\n\n\n\n\n#data #analysis #python #anaconda #analytics",

  "description": "This course is specifically designed for the aspirants who intend to give the \"AWS Solutions Architect - Professional\" level certification as well as for those who intend to gain a deeper understanding related to AWS.\n\nOne of the pre-requisite for the course is the candidate's prior understanding of the core AWS services. We generally recommend completing the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate video course (knowledge-wise) before starting with the AWS Solutions Architect - Professional. However, this requirement can be ignored if a candidate has working experience on AWS.\n\nThere are five primary sections in this course, each section is directly aligned with the official exam blueprint. This course also has an exam preparation section with practice tests to verify if the candidate is ready to give the official certification exams.\n\nKeeping the standards high similar to other best-seller courses of Zeal, this course has a perfect balance and the things are explained in a simplified way with practical scenarios.\n\nWith tons of quizzes, great lectures, and fantastic support from the Instructor, this course is all you need to gain a deeper understanding in AWS and master the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification.\n\nWith this interesting set of learnings and practicals, I look forward to seeing you in this course.",
  "for_who": "Those who are interested in gaining the \"AWS Solutions Architect - Professional\" certification.\nThose who wants to go deep down into AWS technologies."
